                        <h3>Change in Roster Arrangement for Alliance Quests</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Posted on July 26, 2016</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Due to the fact that we have been unsuccessful to 100% alliance quests recently, the officers and I have decided to change the way the roster is organized. </p>

                    <p>Veteran players, or players who are shown to be more active/skillful, will now be designated to the first 2 groups of AQ. Newer/not so active players will be designated to group 3. </p>

                    <p>By having our top players in the 2 groups, we greatly increase our chances of receiving Alliance Quest crystals for all members and getting a chance to get T4 catalysts, which we all love and pray for.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you find that you are in group 3, it is not meant as a form of punishment. It is meant to prove your worth to this alliance. We still expect you to perform your best just as we would with any member. It does not give you an excuse to be lazy and not participate. If you don’t like it, then feel free to leave any time.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, members in groups 1 & 2 that are found to be lacking in participation/skill, will be bumped down to group 3, giving a group 3 member a chance to be in the top 2 groups.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our hope is to someday 100% all 3 Alliance Quests in all 3 groups. This will show us that this alliance is moving on up to the east side. Which, in turn, will allow us to open 3 groups for war, helping guarantee all members a chance to win more shards.</p>
                    
                    <p>Until that day comes though, this is the way it will be for now. </p>

                    <p>
                        Thank you.

                    <hr>
                    <p>We realize that now that we have started to move up in rank for war, people may want to join war, but can't, because slots have been taken up.</p>

                    <p>We want to open up all 3 slots in war, but we will only do so until we get almost full participation in all Alliance Quests.</p>

                    <p>If we can't get full participation in Alliance Quests, then it's a sign we won't get full participation in Alliance Wars, thus making us lose a war and missing out on winning shards.</p>
                    
                    <p>So until we start getting full participation in all Aliiance Quests consitently, we will continue to do 2 groups for war until further notice.</p>

                        Thank you.

                    <p>Over the next 3 AQs, we expect members to follow the roster for AQs.</p>

                    <p>If everyone follows the roster well and each group explores most/all the map, then we plan on opening up war to 3 groups, so everyone can have the chance to win war rewards.</p>

                    <p>However, this depends on the cooperation of everyone in the alliance. If we find that there is not good participation and that members aren’t following the roster, then we will stay with 2 groups for wars until otherwise.</p>

                    <p>Today we are releasing our new website. <a href="http://tiny.cc/coulsonmcoc" />http://tiny.cc/coulsonmcoc</a>
                    <p>From here, players can find rules, updates, spreadsheets, and helpful resources to become stronger.</p>

                    <p>We will also now be implementing a roster, where certain players will have designated spots for certain groups in alliance wars/quests.</p>

                    <p>To find out which group you are assigned to, simply go to the Roster page and find your name on the list. We expect all members to follow this roster. Those who continually don’t will be kicked.</p>

                    <p>Notice that in Alliance Wars, we have given some of our top veteran members reserved spots in each group. All other spots are open to other players. This is because currently, we only do 2 groups for war.</p>

                    <p>However, if players follow the roster and do well in AQs, then we hope to open 3 groups for war in the future.</p>

                    <p>Due to the fact that we have not been reaching the minimum requirements for Summoner Advancement, and have therefor suffered by not receiving our weekly dose of 4* shards, the officers and I have decided that we will now be doing 3 wars (2 groups) a week to make up for it.</p>

                    <p>We also plan on doing AQ 3 once a week, AQ 2 while not in war (or in placement phase), and AQ 1 during war.</p>

                    <p>We also plan on implementing a roster sometime in the future to better improve our efficiency in completing AQ and AW. So certain players will be assigned to certain groups in AQ and AW. But that is still in the works.</p>

                    <p>/pWe know these are quite a few changes, so if you have any questions, just ask.</p>
