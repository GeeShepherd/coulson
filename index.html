                    <p>Thank you to all of our members for making us such a strong alliance and may we continue to become stronger!</p>
                    <p>Next stop, 6 million!</p>

                    </p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Posted on January 17, 2017</p>
                    <div class="banner">
                        <img src="images/aq5.jpg">
                    </div>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Map 5 will now be added to our weekly schedule for AQ and will occur every Tuesday while war is shut down.</p>
                    <h4>----------DONATIONS----------</h4>
                    <p>With the inclusion of map 5 to our weekly schedule, we are also going to start requiring donations from all members. We will now require all members to donate all gold and battlechips won from Alliance Quests into the alliance treasury. The officers and I agree that donating AQ rewards would be the easiest for the alliance since they are an automatic given for AQs win or lose. It also doesn’t require you to grind in arenas just to donate to the treasury. We don’t want to make this game more of a grind than it has to be. </p>
                    <p>We will also require a minimum of 2.5k loyalty donated to the treasury a week as well. Again, this is a small amount that is required. We win about 4k loyalty minimum just for losing a war. So this weekly minimum shouldn’t put you out too much.</p>
                    <p>Of course if you wish to donate more than the minimum, that will of course be helpful, but it is not required nor expected.</p>
                    <h4>------------TIME------------</h4>
                    <p>With the inclusion of map 5. Time will be of the essence. We had it easy when it was free during the Holiday season with the 30 minute timers. But now that we are back on the 1 hour timers, we will have to be extra attentive. We will need all of you to bring you’re A game when we do map 5. Because we all want those precious map 5 crystals and those even more precious T4CCs.</p>
                    <h4>-----------ROSTER-----------</h4>
                    <p>The Map 5 roster may change frequently due to busy schedules. We know some of you have busy lives/school/work schedules. So with that in mind, group 3 will be our ‘relaxed’ group. We do not expect you to finish, but we do still expect you to try your hardest to explore when online. Because the more points we get, the more milestones we will reach. </p>
                    <p>If you are going to be on vacation or think will not be able to perform well in map 5 due to time restraints. Please let us know and we will try to adjust accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Thank you all. And good luck to us!</p>

                    <p>Congragulations team on becoming a 3 million alliance! Some of us still remember when we first broke 1 million and it was quite exciting, but 4 million?! Amazing.</p>
                    <p>Thank you to all of our members for making us such a strong alliance and may we continue to become stronger!</p>
                    <p>Next stop, 4 million!</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>We are excited to announce that we will now be rewarding our top players! The officers and I will be keeping an eye on players who really stand out and who we consider the MVP of the award season (A period ranging from 2-4 weeks). Some of the things we look for in an MVP is that they:</p>

                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Perform well in AQ</li>
                            <li>Perform well in AW</li>
                            <li>Have the best fighting style (Can keep their health high) </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>To keep things fair, award winners will have to wait a certain length of time before they can qualify for MVP again for an award season. This grants more of our top players the chance to win rewards instead of the same player getting rewarded repeatedly. </p>

                    <p>
                        Officers will also be excluded from winning rewards to remove any suspicion of foul play.
                        This will be on a trial basis. If the officers and I suspect foul play or manipulation taking place, or find that this competition starts any conflict between its members or officers, we will cancel it.
                    </p>

                    <p>This is intended to be a fun way to motivate you all to become better and more active players. So let’s please keep this as clean and fun as possible and we hope that you all enjoy it!</p>

                    <p>This Award Season's winner of a $10 iTunes gift card is.... Prince Bengal! </p>

                        <p>Due to the fact that we have been doing so well in 100% in the 2 groups for Alliance Quests, the officers/leader have decided to start doing AQ 3 more often. We will now do AQ3 while not in the attack phase of war, and AQ1 during the attack phase of war. </p>
                        <p>Since we will be participating in harder AQs more often, participation is especially important. So please continue trying your best and keep working on improving your skills to make our alliance better. Work it, make it, do it, makes us Harder, better, faster, stronger!</p>
                        <p>Good job everyone! Keep it up!</p>

                        </p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Due to the fact that we have been unsuccessful to 100% alliance quests recently, the officers and I have decided to change the way the roster is organized. </p>
                        <p>Veteran players, or players who are shown to be more active/skillful, will now be designated to the first 2 groups of AQ. Newer/not so active players will be designated to group 3. </p>
                        <p>By having our top players in the 2 groups, we greatly increase our chances of receiving Alliance Quest crystals for all members and getting a chance to get T4 catalysts, which we all love and pray for.</p>

                        <p>If you find that you are in group 3, it is not meant as a form of punishment. It is meant to prove your worth to this alliance. We still expect you to perform your best just as we would with any member. It does not give you an excuse to be lazy and not participate. If you don’t like it, then feel free to leave any time.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, members in groups 1 & 2 that are found to be lacking in participation/skill, will be bumped down to group 3, giving a group 3 member a chance to be in the top 2 groups.</p>

                        <p>Our hope is to someday 100% all 3 Alliance Quests in all 3 groups. This will show us that this alliance is moving on up to the east side. Which, in turn, will allow us to open 3 groups for war, helping guarantee all members a chance to win more shards.</p>

                        <p>Until that day comes though, this is the way it will be for now. </p>

                        <p>We realize that now that we have started to move up in rank for war, people may want to join war, but can't, because slots have been taken up.</p>
                        <p>We want to open up all 3 slots in war, but we will only do so until we get almost full participation in all Alliance Quests.</p>
                        <p>If we can't get full participation in Alliance Quests, then it's a sign we won't get full participation in Alliance Wars, thus making us lose a war and missing out on winning shards.</p>

                        <p>So until we start getting full participation in all Aliiance Quests consitently, we will continue to do 2 groups for war until further notice.</p>
